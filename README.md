# Gaze-Estimation

- Predicted future gaze points based on previously estimated eye gaze locations using CNNs on a near-eye image
dataset of large volume with high variations.

- Proposed an Appearance-based approach using a dual-model configuration of two lightweight Neural Networks 
without user calibration, to estimate the gaze direction of the human eye. 

- Using the Inceptionv3 model to predict (x, y) coordinates and the SqueezeNet model to
predict the z coordinate, an angular accuracy of 4.89â—¦ has been obtained.
